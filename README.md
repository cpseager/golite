Example code to work with Wonder Workshop robots. For more information:

# IMPORTANT
This is just a simple example of how BLE can be used to operate the robots. Although I have borrowed some images from the original Go application from Wonder Workshop, this application is made by myself as a test-case, and has nothing to do with the Wonder Workshop company.

Have fun playing around!
